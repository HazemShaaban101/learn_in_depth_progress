program functions:
1- prompt user to enter a student's data manually.

2- scan a file for input.
	* the file is predetermined to be named "students.dp" to prevent people from modifying it by mistake since it's not a known format and still needs extra steps to open.
	* the file is formatted as follows "<roll-number><first-name><last-name><GPA><number-of-registered-courses><course-IDs-separated-by-space>".
	* the file is saved in the same directory as executable, included is a premade random file in a folder called "student_database_savefile", this file can be used to test cases such as full database, and invalid file data.
	
3- find student by their roll number.
	* since the roll number is unique and no two students can have the same number, this function loops through all of the database until it finds a match and prints it, then it stops.
	
4- find student by their first name
	* since the first name can be repeated, this function loops through all of the database and prints the full name and roll number of all matches.
	* if no student has a matching first name, print no student found.
	
5- find students registered in course.
	* loop through all students, and for each student loop through all the registered courses and print the student name and roll number of any student registered to the course.
	* if no students are found, print no students found.
	
6- prints info regarding student count and the remaining space in database.

7- delete student using roll number.
	*if no student with matching roll number is found, print no student found.
	
8- update student info using roll number.
	* find student, then prompt user for the values that can be edited.
	* user can pick 1 value to change, to cahnge multiple values the function has to be called again.
	
9- prints all students in the database.

10- saves the database in an external file, then exits the program.
	* saves the database in "students.dp" file, overwriting the old one.
	* the saved file is formatted correctly, so when you open the database again it will read flowlessly without errors.
