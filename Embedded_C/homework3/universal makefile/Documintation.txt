This universal makefile was made by: Hazem Shaaban Bakry
i think i will be maintaining it further, adding things along the way to make it much more universal

functionality now include:
- building object file of any c or assembly file		make <filename>.s/<filename>.c
- linking all objects using your own linker script		make <project name specified in makefile>.elf
- extracting bin from elf					make <project name specified in makefile>.bin
- objdump all object files using -h, -D and nm			make dump_all
- object dump elf file using -h, -D and nm			make dump_elf


things to be checked before using:
- optimization level
- debugging level
- project name
- cross toolchain name
- cpu type
- flags for compiling
- map file




things to add later:
- ability to see files in subfolders
- ability to check if there is a linker script, if not use the toolchain's standard linker settings
- removing errors for file deletion if the file is not present
- adding -help command
