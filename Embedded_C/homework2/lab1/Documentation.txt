This project is made by: Hazem Shaaban Bakry as an assignment for the learn in depth's master embedded systems diploma
it is a short project that sends string to UART0 in versatilepb which is interfaced with terminal, to print the string to terminal

it the objdump and symbols folder, there is a file for each object and for the final elf, containing Headers, objdump, and the symbols
we can notice that all the symbols that were marked unresolved (U) in the object files are finally resolved in the elf file after linking



project notes:
processor: ARM926ej-s
board: versatilePB
system entry point: 0x00010000
stack offset: 0x1000 from location counter, after location counter is done counting the size of all the sections


important notes: this program doesn't start with main, i experimented with a function that calls main, and prints the return code, its not an elegant approach but it was an insightful idea. i now know how the arduino IDE makes two separate functions, one that runs once to initialize peripherals, and the other to loop infinitely
